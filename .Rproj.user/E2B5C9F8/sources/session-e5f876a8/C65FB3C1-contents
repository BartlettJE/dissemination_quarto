# Workshop plan

To follow along in the workshop if you fall behind, we will complete the following steps.

## Example book

## Tour of Quarto

## Creating the book template

## Creating a github repository

You can either start with this point by creating a repository from scratch with a new folder, or creating a repository from an existing folder without a git component.
