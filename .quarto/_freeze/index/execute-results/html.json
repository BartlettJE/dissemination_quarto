You will learn about writing online books, sharing reproducible presentations, and creating websites and blogs.\n\nFor the latest workshop associated with these materials, you can view the [slides here](dissemination_slides.html){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nThere are alternative options to all of these outputs, but once you are comfortable with the workflow of Quarto and github, you will have a flexible toolkit to manage and share all your outputs in one place. Once you render your book/presentation/website and push any changes to github, you get a URL to share with anyone.\n\nFor early career researchers, a website or blog is important for people finding out about you and your work. Before you have the opportunity to publish papers, you will probably have more conference presentations. The ability to share your presentation with a URL will provide more reach than your title and abstract in a programme. For more experienced academics, you might run courses where you want to develop your own materials for your students or share your materials with your peers. An online book is great for impact and sharing your work as wide as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PDF version of this book was last updated on **28th March 2025**.\n\n**Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)**\n\nBy the end of the workshop/book, you will be able to:\n\n-   Use the basic functions of git and github to commit changes and host your materials using github pages.\n\n-   Create an online book using Quarto or the PsyTeachR `booktem` R package in RStudio.\n\n-   Create reproducible presentations using Quarto to combine text, images, and code.\n\n-   Create a simple website and/or blog using Quarto to share your profile and outputs.\n\n-   Communicate your ideas to your target audience using features such as Markdown formatting, code chunks, referencing, glossaries, and interactive questions.\n",
