# Workshop plan

To follow along in the workshop if you fall behind, we will complete the following steps.

## Example book

## Creating the book template

## Tour of the Quarto book template

## Creating a github repository

You can either start with this point by creating a repository from scratch with a new folder, or creating a repository from an existing folder without a git component. 

Publish repository to github

## Tour of github

## Publish to github pages 

Settings >> Pages. Set to none by default. Need to choose Main and /docs to point Github pages to where it needs to look for the rendered html files. 

Wait for actions to show as green tick. 

Check back and at the top of the page, it should give you the url for the page link.

Save to browser shortcut, add to repo about for a quick link. 

Tip: By default, its set to your github username .github.io and your repository name. If you want to get fancy, you can add a custom domain.  

Actions and what to look out for if it does not build. 

## Commiting and pushing changes 

Commit messages and future you 

Reverting changes

## Collaborating on github?
