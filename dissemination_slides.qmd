## Why share you/your work?

::: incremental
-   Although credit/incentives are not always optimal, open materials/tutorials benefit science ([PsyTeachR Team, 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44159-022-00058-8)).

\newline

-   Academics need to work on self-branding to build your profile and reputation ([Dijkstra, 2022](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/campus/building-your-research-profile-social-media-focus-linkedin)).

\newline

-   "For the love of God, share what you do" ([Nordmann, 2025](https://www.emilynordmann.com/post/supporting-scholarship-in-yourself-and-others/)).
