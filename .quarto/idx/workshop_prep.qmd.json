{"title":"Preparation before the workshop","markdown":{"headingText":"Preparation before the workshop","headingAttr":{"id":"workshop_prep","classes":[],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nBefore we can get to the fun stuff, you will need to download a few pieces of software to focus on creating in the workshop.\n\n## The workflow of Quarto and github pages\n\nFor an overview to show why you need the following the pieces of software, you will follow this workflow to create and edit your materials. @fig-img-workflow shows the Quarto/github pages workflow you will follow.\n\n```{r img-workflow, echo=FALSE}\n#| label: fig-img-workflow\n#| fig.cap: \"A flowchart showing the creation and editing process behind a Quarto output and sharing it using github pages.\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A flowchart showing the creation and editing process behind a Quarto output and sharing it using github pages.\"\n#| lightbox: TRUE\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/workflow.png\")\n```\n\n### Creating your output\n\n1.  Create a new project to produce the skeleton of your book/presentation/website.\n\n2.  Edit the basic details of your book, like the title, author(s), and description.\n\n3.  Create a new github repository for your output.\n\n4.  Publish the initial repository so the code is available on github.\n\n5.  Activate github pages to render the book online via a URL.\n\n### Editing your output\n\n1.  Open the output .Rproj file to start working on the materials in RStudio.\n\n2.  Edit or add chapter files in RStudio, specifying their order in the `_quarto.yml` file.\n\n3.  Render individual chapter/section files as you work on them. Render `index.qmd` when you want to update all the chapters, or render them one by one to ensure all new changes are available.\n\n4.  Add commits at key points using git/github to mark milestones with useful commit messages.\n\n5.  When you want the book updating, push the changes to be available on github and your book URL after a short delay.\n\n## Download R and RStudio\n\nIf you are new to R/RStudio, you will need to install both pieces of software which is *normally* pretty straightforward. You might find this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/YrEe2TLr3MI?si=oweIE55Ul77ZoZwz){target=\"_blank\"} useful or the [RSetGo guide](https://psyteachr.github.io/RSetGo/){target=\"_blank\"} we prepared for students in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\n\nIf you are a more experienced R/RStudio user, just make sure you update your version of RStudio as Posit are rapidly developing Quarto. I am currently using `r R.version.string` and RStudio 2024.09.1+394, but the more recent the better.\n\n### Installing Base R\n\n[Install base R](https://cran.rstudio.com/){target=\"_blank\"}. Choose the download link for your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows).\n\nIf you have a Mac, install the latest release from the newest `R-x.x.x.pkg` link (or a legacy version if you have an older operating system). After you install R, you should also install [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/){target=\"_blank\"} to be able to use some visualisation packages.\n\nIf you are installing the Windows version, choose the \"[base](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/)\" subdirectory and click on the download link at the top of the page. After you install R, you should also install [RTools](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/){target=\"_blank\"} and use the \"recommended\" version highlighted near the top of the list.\n\nIf you are using Linux, choose your specific operating system and follow the installation instructions. If you use Linux, you probably do not need help from me.\n\n### Installing RStudio\n\nGo to [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download){target=\"_blank\"} and download the RStudio Desktop version for your operating system. It should recognise your operating system and allow you to download via the blue Download button, but you can look for previous versions if you need one.\n\n### (optional) Install the `booktem` R package\n\nFor one version of a Quarto book, we have a specialised PsyTeachR book template for the School of Psychology and Neuroscience which you can use, but it is contained within a package hosted on Prof. Lisa DeBruine's github called `booktem`. To install the package, run the following code in the Console of RStudio:\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\ndevtools::install_github(\"debruine/booktem\")\n```\n\nIf you are new to R/RStudio, you probably have no user packages installed, so you will get a prompt to allow `booktem` to install the other R packages it depends on to work. This might take a few minutes, so go and enjoy yourself a hot drink.\n\n::: callout-caution\nOne of these messages might say something like \"do you want to compile packages where there is a binary version\" and give you several options to select. You will only be able to select 1 if you have Rtools downloaded on a Windows computer as you need developer tools to do this. Macs should not need any additional software to compile binary packages. These binary versions are normally a little more recent, so its useful to install them if possible.\n:::\n\nIf you are a more experienced R/RStudio user, you might be prompted to update your R packages that `booktem` depends on. Obviously use your judgement if you are in a place to update your packages, but the book template might not work with older packages.\n\n## Download git and github desktop {#github_prep}\n\nPotentially the most unfamiliar element of this process will be working with git and github. If you have not used it before, git is a version control system which tracks file changes on your computer (like OneDrive but for code). github is an online system which uses git to host those changes and make your code available online. There is a graphical user interface called github desktop which I use and will demonstrate. If you want to use the command line version of git/github, you probably do not need me to show you how.\n\nThere is an [installation guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git){target=\"_blank\"} on github, but we have access to a fantastic resource developed by our colleagues in Mathematics and Statistics. They developed an accessible online course on [Moodle](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=41115){target=\"_blank\"} introducing staff and students to version control using git and github. You will need the enrollment code **git_psych_24** to access the course. If you use it, please consider completing their feedback form on the Moodle page so they can improve the resource in future.\n\nThere are 7 units in total which do not take very long, but for the purposes of this workshop, I would consider 1 and 2 as **essential** for downloading git/github desktop and using it as a single user to track changes. Reaching this point will be super helpful for following along in the workshop as the terms will be more familiar to you like repositories, commits, and pushing changes.\n\nIf you have time, completing unit 3 will give you everything you need if you are only using it on your own. If you plan on writing materials in a team, units 4 and 5 cover being a group project user, then 6 and 7 for advanced features.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Apply for education membership\n\nThe standard version of github should meet all your needs, but by working at a university you are eligible to apply for an education membership. If you are interested you can find out more on the [github education site](https://github.com/education/teachers){target=\"_blank\"} for teachers. For example, with an education profile, you can get unlimited private repositories.\n:::\n\n## Finished\n\nYou are ready to make your outputs in the workshop or follow along to the rest of the book
