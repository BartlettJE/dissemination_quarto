    "text": "Overview\nThis book outlines how you can combine Quarto - a new version of R Markdown - with github pages to create an online profile and disseminate your work. You will learn about writing online books, sharing reproducible presentations, and creating websites and blogs.\nThere are alternative options to all of these outputs, but once you are comfortable with the workflow of Quarto and github, you will have a flexible toolkit to manage and share all your outputs in one place. Once you render your book/presentation/website and push any changes to github, you get a URL to share with anyone.\nFor early career researchers, a website or blog is important for people finding out about you and your work. Before you have the opportunity to publish papers, you will probably have more conference presentations. The ability to share your presentation with a URL will provide more reach than your title and abstract in a programme. For more experienced academics, you might run courses where you want to develop your own materials for your students or share your materials with your peers. An online book is great for impact and sharing your work as wide as possible.\nThe PDF version of this book was last updated on 1970-01-01.\nIntended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)\nBy the end of the workshop/book, you will be able to:\n\nUse the basic functions of git and github to commit changes and host your materials using github pages.\nCreate an online book using Quarto or the PsyTeachR booktem R package in RStudio.\nCreate reproducible presentations using Quarto to combine text, images, and code.\nCreate a simple website and/or blog using Quarto to share your profile and outputs.\nCommunicate your ideas to your target audience using features such as Markdown formatting, code chunks, referencing, glossaries, and interactive questions.",

Render index.qmd when you want to update all the chapters, or render them one by one to ensure all new changes are available.\nAdd commits at key points using git/github to mark milestones with useful commit messages.\nWhen you want the book updating, push the changes to be available on github and your book URL after a short delay.",

    "section": "1.2 Download R and RStudio",
    "text": "1.2 Download R and RStudio\nIf you are new to R/RStudio, you will need to install both pieces of software which is normally pretty straightforward. You might find this YouTube video useful or the RSetGo guide we prepared for students in the School of Psychology and Neuroscience.\nIf you are a more experienced R/RStudio user, just make sure you update your version of RStudio as Posit are rapidly developing Quarto. I am currently using R version 4.4.1 (2024-06-14 ucrt) and RStudio 2024.09.1+394, but the more recent the better.\n\n1.2.1 Installing Base R\nInstall base R. Choose the download link for your operating system (Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows).\nIf you have a Mac, install the latest release from the newest R-x.x.x.pkg link (or a legacy version if you have an older operating system). After you install R, you should also install XQuartz to be able to use some visualisation packages.\nIf you are installing the Windows version, choose the “base” subdirectory and click on the download link at the top of the page. After you install R, you should also install RTools and use the “recommended” version highlighted near the top of the list.\nIf you are using Linux, choose your specific operating system and follow the installation instructions. If you use Linux, you probably do not need help from me.\n\n\n1.2.2 Installing RStudio\nGo to rstudio.com and download the RStudio Desktop version for your operating system. It should recognise your operating system and allow you to download via the blue Download button, but you can look for previous versions if you need one.\n\n\n1.2.3 (optional) Install the booktem R package\nFor one version of a Quarto book, we have a specialised PsyTeachR book template for the School of Psychology and Neuroscience which you can use, but it is contained within a package hosted on Prof. Lisa DeBruine’s github called booktem. To install the package, run the following code in the Console of RStudio:\n\ndevtools::install_github(\"debruine/booktem\")\n\nIf you are new to R/RStudio, you probably have no user packages installed, so you will get a prompt to allow booktem to install the other R packages it depends on to work. This might take a few minutes, so go and enjoy yourself a hot drink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nOne of these messages might say something like “do you want to compile packages where there is a binary version” and give you several options to select. You will only be able to select 1 if you have Rtools downloaded on a Windows computer as you need developer tools to do this. Macs should not need any additional software to compile binary packages. These binary versions are normally a little more recent, so its useful to install them if possible.\n\n\nIf you are a more experienced R/RStudio user, you might be prompted to update your R packages that booktem depends on. Obviously use your judgement if you are in a place to update your packages, but the book template might not work with older packages.",

    "section": "1.3 Download git and github desktop",
    "text": "1.3 Download git and github desktop\nPotentially the most unfamiliar element of this process will be working with git and github. If you have not used it before, git is a version control system which tracks file changes on your computer (like OneDrive but for code). github is an online system which uses git to host those changes and make your code available online. There is a graphical user interface called github desktop which I use and will demonstrate. If you want to use the command line version of git/github, you probably do not need me to show you how.\nThere is an installation guide on github, but we have access to a fantastic resource developed by our colleagues in Mathematics and Statistics. They developed an accessible online course on Moodle introducing staff and students to version control using git and github. You will need the enrollment code git_psych_24 to access the course. If you use it, please consider completing their feedback form on the Moodle page so they can improve the resource in future.\nThere are 7 units in total which do not take very long, but for the purposes of this workshop, I would consider 1 and 2 as essential for downloading git/github desktop and using it as a single user to track changes. Reaching this point will be super helpful for following along in the workshop as the terms will be more familiar to you like repositories, commits, and pushing changes.\nIf you have time, completing unit 3 will give you everything you need if you are only using it on your own. If you plan on writing materials in a team, units 4 and 5 cover being a group project user, then 6 and 7 for advanced features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApply for education membership\n\n\n\nThe standard version of github should meet all your needs, but by working at a university you are eligible to apply for an education membership. If you are interested you can find out more on the github education site for teachers. For example, with an education profile, you can get unlimited private repositories.",
