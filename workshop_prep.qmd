# Preparation before the workshop {#workshop_prep}

Before we can get to the fun stuff, you will need to download a few pieces of software to your computer.

## Book workflow

For an overview to show why you need the following the pieces of software, the workflow for creating and editing the book is:

### Creating the book

1.  

### Editing the book

1.  

## Download R and RStudio

## Download git and github

Potentially the most unfamiliar element of this process will be working with git and github. If you have not used it before, git is a version control system which tracks file changes on your computer. github is an online system which uses git to host those changes and make your code available online.

There is an [installation guide](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git){target="_blank"} on github, but we have access to a fantastic resource developed by our colleagues in Mathematics and Statistics. They developed an online course on [Moodle](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=41115){target="_blank"} introducing staff and students to git and github. You will need the enrollment code **git_psych_24** to access the course.

There are 7 units in total, but for the purposes of this workshop, I would consider 1 and 2 as essential for downloading git/github and using it as a single user to track changes. Reaching this point will be super helpful for following on as easy as possible in the workshop.

If you have time, completing unit 3 will give you everything you need if you are only using it on your own. If you plan on writing the book in a team, units 4 and 5 cover being a group project user, then 6 and 7 for advanced features.

Apply for education membership.

## Finished

You are ready to make a book in the workshop!
