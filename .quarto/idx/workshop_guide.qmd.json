I have edited the first two chapters to use new Quarto features, so they can provide inspiration for what you can do with the book template.\n\n## Creating the book template\n\nIf you have not followed the [preparation instructions](#workshop_prep) yet, you need R/RStudio installed to your computer, the `booktem` package installed from Lisa's github, and git/github desktop installed on your computer. I will be demonstrating how to use github desktop rather than the command line. \n\nThe first step is thinking about where you want your book folder stored on your computer, where all the files will live. I have a folder within `Documents` called `git_repos` where I store all my git repositories away from OneDrive (see below). You do not need to create a folder for the book itself as the function will do that for you, but you need somewhere for that folder to live. \n\n::: callout-warning\n#### Do not create github repositories within OneDrive\n\nWe have not reached the github step yet, but as you think about where you want your folder for the book, please **do not** use a folder within OneDrive. Sometimes it works, but most of the time is causes chaos as OneDrive is trying to track changes, github is trying to track changes, which ends in them fighting over file permissions.\n:::\n\nOnce you have a folder your book can live in, set your working directory to this folder, for example from the top menu `Session >> set working directory >> Choose directory` and navigate to this folder. \n\nOnce RStudio knows where you want your working directory, you can create the book using the following code in the console and editing accordingly before you run the code. Do not worry though, you can edit all of these later, but this will create the initial version.  \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# We first need to load the booktem library, assuming its installed properly\nlibrary(booktem)\n\ncreate_book(path = \"\", # If you set your working directory, you should not need to edit this\n            title = \"My book title\", # The main title of your book\n            authors = list( # You need a new line for any additional author, or delete the author 2 line if you're solo\n              c(\"Author 1 first name\", \"Author 1 last name\", \"Author 1 ORCiD\"),\n              c(\"Author 2 first name\", \"Author 2 last name\", \"Author 2 ORCiD\"))\n            )\n```\n\nOnce you press run, you should get a bunch of progress messages. Once its finished, your book will open in a new session. Congratulations, you have a book skeleton to work with! \n\n## Tour of the Quarto book template\n\n1. _quarto.yml\n\n::: callout-note\n#### What is a .yml file?\n\n.yml files express different options and must follow a specific format. \n:::\n\n2. index.qmd\n\n3. `include/` folder \n\n4. Chapter files\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf you are converting a previous book to the new template, there is a handy little function `rmd2qmd`. This copies .Rmd files and renames them to .qmd. The function looks like this \n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nrmd2qmd(from_path = \"\", # file path where your .Rmd files are\n        to_path = \"\") # file path where your .qmd files shoul go\n```\n\nwhere you specify a file path to access the old .Rmd files and a file path to where you want the new .qmd files saving. Keep your working directory in mind as you will probably be starting from your book folder at this point. I usually save my old .Rmd files in a folder within the new book directory, then save the new .qmd files to the new book main directory. \n:::\n\n5. Rendering files\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe single best part of Quarto and the new book template is you can keep rendering and checking what your work looks like in the flesh. Previously, you had to render the whole book to check how it rendered, but now you can keep updating the browser to see what your changes look like. \n:::\n\n::: callout-caution\nIf you introduce an error, you will get an error and red box on the screen to highlight Quarto cannot render the book. If you look in the Background Jobs tab in the console below, you should get an error message for the source of the problem if you are unsure what you did wrong. \n\nAfter an error, you will need press Render again rather than just refreshing the browser. \n:::\n\n## Creating a github repository\n\nYou can either start with this point by creating a repository from scratch with a new folder, or creating a repository from an existing folder without a git component.\n\nPublish repository to github\n\nDO NOT create in OneDrive\n\n## Tour of github\n\n## Publish to github pages\n\nSettings \\>\\> Pages. Set to none by default. Need to choose Main and /docs to point Github pages to where it needs to look for the rendered html files.\n\nWait for actions to show as green tick.\n\nCheck back and at the top of the page, it should give you the url for the page link.\n\nSave to browser shortcut, add to repo about for a quick link.\n\nTip: By default, its set to your github username .github.io and your repository name. If you want to get fancy, you can add a custom domain.\n\nActions and what to look out for if it does not build.\n\n## Commiting and pushing changes\n\nCommit messages and future you\n\nReverting changes\n\n## Collaborating on github?\n\n## Start working on your own book!\n\nStart working on your own book in the remaining time we have together.\n\nSee the next chapter on [Quarto features and book conventions](#quarto_features) for inspiration / example code for the kind of features you can use.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["include/webex.css"],"include-after-body":["include/webex.js"],"output-file":"workshop_guide.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
