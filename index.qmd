# Overview {.unnumbered}

This book outlines how you can combine [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html){target="_blank"} - a new version of R Markdown - with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/){target="_blank"} to create an online profile and disseminate your work. You will learn about writing online books, sharing reproducible presentations, and creating websites and blogs.

There are alternative options to all of these outputs, but once you are comfortable with the workflow of Quarto and github, you will have a flexible toolkit to manage and share all your outputs in one place. Once you render your book/presentation/website and push any changes to github, you get a URL to share with anyone.

For early career researchers, a website or blog is important for people finding out about you and your work. Before you have the opportunity to publish papers, you will probably have more conference presentations. The ability to share your presentation with a URL will provide more reach than your title and abstract in a programme. For more experienced academics, you might run courses where you want to develop your own materials for your students or share your materials with your peers. An online book is great for impact and sharing your work as wide as possible.
